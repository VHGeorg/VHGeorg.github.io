<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The "Wood damage ontology" helps to define and document wood damages in construction. Wood damage experts can use this ontology for writing reports. It focuses on wood components and can be used in all areas of structural damage where wood has been installed. It is an extension of the damage topology ontology (dot) and falls under the category of classified damage. It defines damage types, associated causes, repair methods and investigation procedures. All these categories are part of the report. In the ontology, these categories are defined and have connections to each other.</span>
